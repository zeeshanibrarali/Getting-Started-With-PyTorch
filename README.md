# Getting started with Pytorch

I have recently gained knowledge on how to utilize PyTorch, an open-source machine learning framework that is known for its simplicity, performance, and APIs. During my learning, I have explored the fundamental concepts of PyTorch, such as tensors, operators, and conversion to and from NumPy. I have also learned how to use autograd, which tracks the history of every computation recorded by the framework. Besides, I have acquired skills in Torchvision, Torchaudio, and Torchtext.
